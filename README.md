# hackathon
Our project aims to solve when to service your car.
To tackle our problem we made a ui and java code.
In our java code we wanted the user to give us their car model and mileage so we can
return an approximated value of when they would need to get their car maintenanced.
We used java swing to code the interface.

We were unable to link our ui and java code.
We had planned to make ios app but then we realized we do not have the right software so we switched and decided.
to make a java implementing a sql database.
We attempted to use github but then we ran into so many problems since it was our first time using the github.
